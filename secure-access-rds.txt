Answer
what i think is the best answer to this is creating security groups for pods.
that way, we can grant acess to external aws services - such as RDS - just to some pods which needs it, that are running on the same K8S worker nodes. 
what we will need to do (assuming EKS and RDS are already up and running):
* create a security group for pods which needs access to RDS 
* Enable pods ENI
* create service account for pods which needs access to RDS 
* create security group policy (SGP) which contains two security groups: one is the EKS SG which enables pods comunication inside the cluster, and the seccond 
one which we crated for pods which needs RDS access.
* Finally, when we create a pod which needs RDS access, we will add in it's definition yaml, in the spec section, the service account which we created.
